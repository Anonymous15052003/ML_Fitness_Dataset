# ML_Fitness_Dataset

Downloaded a dataset from kaggle.com and applied at least 10 pre-processing steps to the dataset using python programming.

Used the python library like matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2, plotly etc. and analysed the data. Understood the inference from the charts.

Applied any five Machine Learning algorithm for the same dataset and compared the accuracy ratio :-
1) K-Nearest Neighbors
2) Linear SVM Score
3) Decision Tree Score
4) Multilayer Perceptron Score
5) Gaussian Naive Bayes Score
